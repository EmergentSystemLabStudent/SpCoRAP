Imagine a scenario where a robot is working in a home and is given an instruction to put away an object.

Using the object name and place name below, create one natural instruction like the example provided.

About half the time, reword either the object name or the place name using a **natural paraphrase**.  
In particular, can generalize specific locations into room-level descriptions when appropriate  
(e.g., "in front of TV" → "living room", or "strawberry" → "red fruits").  
You may reword both, one, or neither — whichever sounds most natural and clear.
- Target object name: {OBJECT_NAME}
- Target place name about object: {LOCATION_NAME_ABOUT_OBJECT}
- Target place name about put away: {LOCATION_NAME_ABOUT_PUTTING_AWAY}

- Example object name: candy
- Example place name about object: bedroom
- Example place name about put away: dining room
- Example: Put away the candy in the bedroom to the dining area.

Guidelines:
- Do not include any names of other objects and places in the instruction.
- Write only the instruction — no additional sentences or explanations.
- Keep the instruction natural, concise, and easy to understand.
