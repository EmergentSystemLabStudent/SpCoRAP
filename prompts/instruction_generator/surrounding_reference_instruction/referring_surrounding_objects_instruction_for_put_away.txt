Imagine a scenario where a robot is working in a home and is given an instruction to put away an object.
Using the target object name and the list of surrounding objects below, create one natural instruction like the example provided.
About half the time, reword the object name using a **natural paraphrase**.  
- Target object name: {TARGET_OBJECT}
- List of surrounding objects: {LIST_OF_SURROUNDING_OBJECTS}
- Information about where to put away: {INFORMATION_ABOUT_WHERE_TO_PUT_AWAY}

- (Example) Object name: candy
- (Example) List of surrounding objects: ["apple", "orange", "cracker box"]
- (Example) Information about where to put away: ["sponge", "plate", "bowl"]
- (Example) Instruction sentence: Take the candy located near both the cracker box and the orange, and put it around the plate and the bowl.

Guidelines:
- Do not include any place names in the instruction sentence.
- Be sure to use object names from the list of surrounding objects, excluding the target object, and include them in the instruction sentence.
- Include 2 to 3 surrounding object names in the instruction sentence.
- Include 2 to 3 names of the object listed in the information about the place to be put away in the instruction sentence.
- Write only the instruction sentence; do not include any other text.
- You can phrase the instruction however you like. It's fine to reword or keep the object name and the name of surrounding object as is.
