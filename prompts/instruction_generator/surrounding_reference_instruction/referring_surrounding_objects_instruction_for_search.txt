Imagine a scenario where a robot is working in a home and is given an instruction to search for an object.
Using the target object name and the list of surrounding objects below, create one natural instruction like the example provided.
About half the time, reword the object name using a **natural paraphrase**.  
- Target object name: {TARGET_OBJECT}
- List of surrounding objects: {LIST_OF_SURROUNDING_OBJECTS}

- (Example) Object name: candy
- (Example) List of surrounding objects: ["apple", "orange", "cracker box"]
- (Example) Instruction sentence: Search for a candy around the cracker box and orange

Guidelines:
- Do not include any place names in the instruction sentence.
- Be sure to use object names from the list of surrounding objects, excluding the target object, and include them in the instruction sentence.
- Include 2 to 3 surrounding object names in the instruction sentence.
- Write only the instruction sentence; do not include any other text.
- You can phrase the instruction however you like. It's fine to reword or keep the object name and the name of surrounding object as is.
