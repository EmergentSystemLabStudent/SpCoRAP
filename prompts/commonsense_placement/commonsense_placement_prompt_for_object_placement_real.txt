I would like to know where each object is most commonly observed within a household.

For each object in the List of Object below, please select the top 3 locations where it is most likely to be found in a typical home environment.

⚠️ Important instructions:
- You must only select locations from the List of Place.
- Do not include or invent any locations that are not in the List of Place (e.g., 'bathroom', 'laundry room').
- Even if none of the listed places seem like a perfect fit for an object, you must still choose the most plausible or least implausible ones from the list.
- Never output location names that are not present in the List of Place.

List of Object:
{OBJECT_NAME_LIST}

List of Place:
{LOCATION_NAME_LIST}

Output format:
object_name: [top1_place, top2_place, top3_place]

Example:
notebook_pc: [bedroom, living room, dining room]
